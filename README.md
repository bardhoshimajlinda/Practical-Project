# Pizza Ordering Terminal App

This Java console application provides a simple pizza ordering system. Users can interact with the terminal to check existing orders or create new ones. 
The app includes a menu listing pizza options, and users can add items to their order, specifying the quantity of each item. Order details, including the total cost, are displayed, 
and each order is assigned a unique code. The application uses Hibernate for data persistence and MySQL as the underlying database.
